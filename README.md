## Usage

You can use this study guide webpage to keep your notes for future reference. Whenever you get stuck on a topic during the bootcamp like JavaScript, you can always refer back to this study guide webpage and look over the notes you have on the webpage. There will be a bombardment of information in a short period of time, so this study guide webpage is a good way to lose track and fall behind.
